            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">For this project, the 
            main goal was to create or 
            improve a game or story using Scratch. Since this was the 
            first project of the year, I had learned a lot about the 
            process of creating a project. My partner and I chose to 
            create a space-themed game. While we were happy with our 
            end product, there were some obstacles along the way.
            First, it took some time getting used to working with a 
            partner. We both had different ideas and we had to make
            multiple compromises. After the initial start, we were able
            to work well with each other and collaborate efficiently. I 
            learned how to properly 
            <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSer7iR5up-3iYq7QT4r6ZQ7v4MhzX6MF6K-viGCWys/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> document</a> 
            the process and some
            effective methods of brainstorming. In this project,
            my partner and I were able to use our personal skills to
            our advantage. We worked on main code together, but we
            both focused on areas we were good at. I began to add styles, buttons,
            sprites, and backgrounds to create the effect of an 
            actual game. My partner worked on troubleshooting and 
            adding new features to the game. Creating our Scratch 
            game helped me learn how to organize and present project
            documentation. I was also able to see how creativity and 
            computer science can go together. </p> <br>
