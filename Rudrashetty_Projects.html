            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">For this project, the 
            main goal was to create or 
            improve a game or story using Scratch. Since this was the 
            first project of the year, I had learned a lot about the 
            process of creating a project. My partner and I chose to 
            create a space-themed game. While we were happy with our 
            end product, there were some obstacles along the way.
            First, it took some time getting used to working with a 
            partner. We both had different ideas and we had to make
            multiple compromises. After the initial start, we were able
            to work well with each other and collaborate efficiently. I 
            learned how to properly 
            <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSer7iR5up-3iYq7QT4r6ZQ7v4MhzX6MF6K-viGCWys/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> document</a> 
            the process and some
            effective methods of brainstorming. In this project,
            my partner and I were able to use our personal skills to
            our advantage. We worked on main code together, but we
            both focused on areas we were good at. I began to add styles, buttons,
            sprites, and backgrounds to create the effect of an 
            actual game. My partner worked on troubleshooting and 
            adding new features to the game. Creating our Scratch 
            game helped me learn how to organize and present project
            documentation. I was also able to see how creativity and 
            computer science can go together. </p> <br>

        <h4>Hangman Project</h4>
        <h4>Febuary 5, 2019</h4>
        <h4>Computer Science Principles</h4>
        <div>
            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">The objective of this project was
            to create an online themed 
            hangman game using Python. By this time, my partner and I had 
            already worked together on one project before and we were already
            accustomed to the process. We decided to make our game Percy Jackson
            themed. The mystery words we had were all either characters or items
            from the book series. My partner and I both worked on the code to
            make the game possible. However, it did take some time to create an 
            initial working game. For us, it was challenging to have a letter 
            show up once the correct letter was guessed. After we had the basic
            game complete, we began to add new features like a storyline and a
            given number of guesses. Then we completed our <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10EbEVtRR_QEWUr3_Vs4644zia7QLHlb-H58Pw2IpKhE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> documentation</a> 
            This project taught me the importance of
            comments. We had to use comments to explain a lot of our code so we
            could understand it later on and add more changes if we wanted to. 
            Also, we learned how to write proper docstrings that thoroughly 
            explain a function. Overall, I learned how to overcome challenges 
            and how to avoid getting frustrated when the code didn't work the
            way I wanted it to. Additionally, I learned the importance of 
            sharing and communicating ideas in order to collaborate efficiency 
            to reach our desired goal.</p>

        <div>
            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">The objective of this <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFmvULxmuSAR0-5LI_iYzw4P8-ULXWf2YM2Y6vmPp0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> project</a> 
 was to create a vehicle using Vex parts that
                would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells and solar cells. The vehicleâ€™s constraints included that it had to be
                at most 5 by 12 inches and be able to run under multiple configurations. These configurations included one or 
                two hydrogen cells and one or two solar cells. For this project, I worked in a team of four to create a working 
                prototype. The project had many components that needed to be accomplished in a short period. 
                These included the prototype and <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8nI8xI3i7OGo4l5APB1wBNOoOjps6Iix2TSwCmlUWs/edit?usp=sharing"_blank" target="_blank"> documentation.</a> My team and I continuously ran into many issues. For example, 
                we had trouble fitting our vehicle within the given constraints. This caused us to start the painstaking process
                of rebuilding and revising most of the structure. We had also run into the issue of too much weight and friction
                which prevented the car from moving. My role in this project was primarily the building and testing portions. I 
                contributed ideas on how to secure the cells and motor to the vehicle. I often assisted with building and worked
                to get the vehicle to fit within the given constraints. With the testing part, I helped make adjustments
                to the vehicle so that it would be lighter. The constant revisions we made to our prototype before presenting the 
                final solution gave me a better understanding of the design process and how alterations and deviations from the
                original idea are inevitable. I also understood the importance of brainstorming and having a solid plan before 
                beginning to build. Finally, teamwork was especially exemplified during this project because my entire team often
                had to work during our free period or lunch. </p>

                    while using our knowledge about material science, engineering design, and statics. In teams of two, each 
                    team member was required to create two viable bridge designs. One final design was chosen with the use 
                    of a decision matrix to continue to be modified into the most ideal bridge. The bridges were composed
                    from three materials: carbon steel, high strength low alloy steel, and quenched and tempered steel in 
                    either solid or hollow bars. Additionally, factors like the excavation site and bridge supports could 
                    also be modified. The final design needed to be under $30,000 and able to support the weight of the truck, 
                    concrete deck, main tresses, and supporting beams. My contributions to this project included creating the
                    first two bridge design ideas. I experimented with the excavation site settings and the multiple bridge 
                    support features available, such as the pier, cable anchorages, and abutments. Additionally, the
                    <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5lkXzU64ZeE-9YnIfav4iRd49QUTio_HvtwsGQSaFY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> for this project included a lot of research. I worked on the Research Summary and the 
                    Final Design Summary. Throughout this project, I had also realized the importance of collaboration. 
                    My teammate and I learned how to communicate our ideas effectively while we were modifying and choosing
                    our final design. We also learned to collaborate online and outside of class when the school unexpectedly
                    shut down. Teamwork was also an exemplified skill since my partner and I continued to work together even 
                    when we werenâ€™t able to collaborate face to face. By the end of the project deadline, we successfully 
                    completed the online documentation, final bridge design, and a <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cxrmhMebop91Rj1C_tsZPbUHLTBnJ8KGBuIa6mWsAcM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">powerpoint presentation</a> showcasing our

    <h4>COVID-19 Pandemic Model</h4>
        <h4>August 15, 2020</h4>
        <h4>AP Computer Science Applications</h4>
        <div>
                    <p style="font-family: Montserrat;"> The objective of this project was to extend a model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greenfoot by adding various factors such
                    as the impact of stay at home orders and the rates of deaths and infection. This model was based upon the one created by Professor Michael Kolling at King's College, London.
                    This project was my first exposure to programming in Java and in Greenfoot. I began this project on my own by deciding what additional factors I wanted to add to the model. I ultimately 
                    decided to add the impact of wearing masks and sheltering in place. Individuals that sheltered in place would have had a zero percent chance of getting infected, while those who were wearing
                    mask would have a very slim chance. Additionally, I decided to add the realistic factor of people dying as a result of the virus. In my model, only people who had been infected before could have
                    died from the virus at a mortality rate of five percent. Once a person had died, they would no longer be participating in the program so they couldn't infect others or heal themselves. Throughout this
                    project I faced many difficulties mainly because it was my first time created a full project in Java. I noticed that I had to be patient with myself and give myself enough time to thoroughly understand
                    the code before moving on. One major issue I faced was making it so that individuals who had sheltered in place or who died were no longer participating in the program. In order words, they should
                    not longer be actors in the world because I didn't want them to get infected, infect others, or heal. However, with a little time spent adjusting my initial code, I was able to fix this issue by removing actors from 
                    the world once they stayed at home or died. Although I was working on my own, I had learned the importance of organization and project planning. I started by breaking down the large project into smaller tasks with a set
                    schedule so I would be able to stay on track and finish the project in time. This is definitely something I improved upon after completing my first project in AP Computer Science Applications.

        <div>
                    <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">The objective of this <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBxS1j3zOlCW6kBtehB_URrhCwiIHA6tLfYfhs8_ffM/edit" target="_blank">project</a> 
                    was to brainstorm, develop, and test an educational and entertaining game in Java. Using what we had learned during the semester, we utilized concepts in Java such as conditionals, loops, classes, and objects
                    to build an advanced game that could be used to convey information or teach a concept. In our case, my team of four decided to go with a trivia game that tested the user on general knowledge as
                    well as geography. This was done through the implementation of the Google Maps API in Greenfoot. We began the project by brainstorming potential ideas for a game. We evaluated our topic choices on factors such
                    as creativity, feasibility, and difficulty through a decision matrix. We wanted our game to be unique, but also realistic within the given timeline. It was also important that we included
                    concepts we learned in class. My contributions in this project included created a backstory that would keep the user engaged in the game. I also helped implement the trivia questions, and tested the 
                    prototype numerous times to ensure that it was working the way we wanted it to. I was able to fix a bug when certain answers were declared to be correct, even if they were not. Additionally, I also helped
                    create code that would cause the questions to appear in the same order each time and wouldn't repeat after the user had already answered them. This was to make our finished product look more 
                    polished and it also helped with the troubleshooting process. My final major contribution included working on the <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaVuqAsb8oLfpiBNdZIa3Lp09pfC6rPG-ezkOGJqqwU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation.</a>
                    Throughout my experiences with the project, I learned many important skills while also strengthening my knowledge in Java. But, most importantly, I understood the importance of team cooperation. Especially since this
                    project was through virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, my group and I had to find ways to communicate our ideas effectively since we weren't able to talk in person. We also had difficulty collaborating on a
                    single Greenfoot project. We solved these issues by scheduling lots of time outside of class either by texting or through Zoom calls. This extra time really helped us develop our ideas further and polish
                    our final product so that it was ready to be used by others. </p>
