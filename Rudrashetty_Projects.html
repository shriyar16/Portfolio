            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">For this project, the 
            main goal was to create or 
            improve a game or story using Scratch. Since this was the 
            first project of the year, I had learned a lot about the 
            process of creating a project. My partner and I chose to 
            create a space-themed game. While we were happy with our 
            end product, there were some obstacles along the way.
            First, it took some time getting used to working with a 
            partner. We both had different ideas and we had to make
            multiple compromises. After the initial start, we were able
            to work well with each other and collaborate efficiently. I 
            learned how to properly 
            <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSer7iR5up-3iYq7QT4r6ZQ7v4MhzX6MF6K-viGCWys/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> document</a> 
            the process and some
            effective methods of brainstorming. In this project,
            my partner and I were able to use our personal skills to
            our advantage. We worked on main code together, but we
            both focused on areas we were good at. I began to add styles, buttons,
            sprites, and backgrounds to create the effect of an 
            actual game. My partner worked on troubleshooting and 
            adding new features to the game. Creating our Scratch 
            game helped me learn how to organize and present project
            documentation. I was also able to see how creativity and 
            computer science can go together. </p> <br>

            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">The objective of this project was
            to create an online themed 
            hangman game using Python. By this time, my partner and I had 
            already worked together on one project before and we were already
            accustomed to the process. We decided to make our game Percy Jackson
            themed. The mystery words we had were all either characters or items
            from the book series. My partner and I both worked on the code to
            make the game possible. However, it did take some time to create an 
            initial working game. For us, it was challenging to have a letter 
            show up once the correct letter was guessed. After we had the basic
            game complete, we began to add new features like a storyline and a
            given number of guesses. Then we completed our <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10EbEVtRR_QEWUr3_Vs4644zia7QLHlb-H58Pw2IpKhE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> documentation</a> 
            This project taught me the importance of
            comments. We had to use comments to explain a lot of our code so we
            could understand it later on and add more changes if we wanted to. 
            Also, we learned how to write proper docstrings that thoroughly 
            explain a function. Overall, I learned how to overcome challenges 
            and how to avoid getting frustrated when the code didn't work the
            way I wanted it to. Additionally, I learned the importance of 
            sharing and communicating ideas in order to collaborate efficiency 
            to reach our desired goal.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">The objective of this <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFmvULxmuSAR0-5LI_iYzw4P8-ULXWf2YM2Y6vmPp0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> project</a> 
 was to create a vehicle using Vex parts that
                would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells and solar cells. The vehicleâ€™s constraints included that it had to be
                at most 5 by 12 inches and be able to run under multiple configurations. These configurations included one or 
                two hydrogen cells and one or two solar cells. For this project, I worked in a team of four to create a working 
                prototype. The project had many components that needed to be accomplished in a short period. 
                These included the prototype and <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8nI8xI3i7OGo4l5APB1wBNOoOjps6Iix2TSwCmlUWs/edit?usp=sharing"_blank" target="_blank"> documentation.</a> My team and I continuously ran into many issues. For example, 
                we had trouble fitting our vehicle within the given constraints. This caused us to start the painstaking process
                of rebuilding and revising most of the structure. We had also run into the issue of too much weight and friction
                which prevented the car from moving. My role in this project was primarily the building and testing portions. I 
                contributed ideas on how to secure the cells and motor to the vehicle. I often assisted with building and worked
                to get the vehicle to fit within the given constraints. With the testing part, I helped make adjustments
                to the vehicle so that it would be lighter. The constant revisions we made to our prototype before presenting the 
                final solution gave me a better understanding of the design process and how alterations and deviations from the
                original idea are inevitable. I also understood the importance of brainstorming and having a solid plan before 
                beginning to build. Finally, teamwork was especially exemplified during this project because my entire team often
                had to work during our free period or lunch. </p>
