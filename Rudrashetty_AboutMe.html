                        <p>Currently, I am a freshman in high school. But, after I graduate, I would like to pursue a career in Computer Science Engineering. To achieve this goal, I hope to gain exposure and develop an interest in this field throughout my four years of high school. I plan to join clubs and organizations relating to the engineering field and maybe start a club of my own to share what I have learned! Although I am fairly new to this area, I am excited to learn more and expand by learning. I believe this career is well suited for me  because I have an affinity for building and creating things. I enjoy working with computers and I find the process fun and exciting. Also, I would like to make a change in the world and help people. A career in an industry like computer science seems to be a good way to achieve that. </p>
                        <p>Some of my major accomplishments from middle school include winning 5th place at the Regional Science Olympiad Competition. I was on the same team and participated in the same events (Forensics, Epidemiology, and Optics) for two years. For the first year of the competition, my team and I did not do as well as we had hoped. So, in preparation for the following year, we worked more and studied harder. As a result, we placed 6th out of 30 school across the Bay Area. I had also won 5th and 6th place in two of my events. Also, to gain more experience in the Computer Science field, I began to participate in Cyberpatriots. In my opinion, simply having the courage to try something new and being open to new ideas was an accomplishment. I was able to attend first competition this past November. Although there are a few more skills I needed to work on, I was proud of myself for being able to attend the competetion and do my best. </p>
                        <p>My experiences throughout my schooling has taught me many valuable lessons. First, I had learned how to be patient with myself when taking a difficult class. Although academics were my strong suite, I got frustrated a lot when I did not understand something. When presented with a challenge, I normally would have chosen to walk away rather than to face it. This happened a lot during my Geometry class over the summer. Overtime, I learned to be patient with myself and give myself time to understand the material.  As a result, I understood the concepts being taught in class and performed better on the finals. Furthermore, after entering high school this year, I able to grasp how to effectively manage all my classes and extracurriculars. Unlike middle school, I had a lot more on my plate and had to concentrate on balancing everything. I learned to manage my time and focus on my priorities.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I believe I am a reliable person. I have been part of a couple clubs and teams and I enjoy working with others. I feel that I can be trusted with work and that I can perform my best. Additionally, I am also creative. I enjoy making things and coming up with solutions to obstacles. I can come up with good ideas and form original thoughts. I also believe my personality is charismatic and kind. I enjoy being around people and interacting with others, especially people I do not know a lot about. Although I can be sometimes be reserved, I love talking to others and helping them out in any way I can.</p>
                        <p>All in all, thank you for taking your time to read this section of my portfolio. I encourage you to explore the rest of my website. Thank you!</p><br>
