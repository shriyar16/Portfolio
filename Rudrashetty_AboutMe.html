                        <p>Hi! My name is Shriya Rudrashetty. Currently, I am a senior at Dublin High School. After graduating high school, I plan to pursue a career in 
                            computer science. To achieve this goal, I gained exposure to the field of computer science through extracurriculars and classes at DHS. 
                            For example, choosing to take electives such as Honors Principles of Engineering and AP Computer Science Applications allowed me to build and 
                            strengthen the skills necessary to be successful in this field. Attending guest speaker events and field trips providing a glimpse into computer 
                            science in the working world, enabling me to learn more about the various career options available. In college and beyond, I am excited to continue 
                            my journey with engineering and computer science through similar classes, clubs, and personal projects. I believe computer science as a career is 
                            well suited for me because I enjoy problem solving and the chance to use my creativity. Engineering also involves the intersection between 
                            mathematics and science and their applications in the real world, which greatly interests me.</p>
                        
                        <p>Last summer, I received the opportunity to intern at NASA Ames Research Center. Through this internship, I was able to see the intersection between 
                            environmental science, aerospace engineering, and computer science. Working with a team of 6, the internship involves researching the environmental 
                            impact of the aviation industry as well as methodologies to move towards a more sustainable future. Environmental solutions such as the usage of 
                            renewable fuel and technological solutions such as machine learning software were explored. More specifically, the impact of the new IADs software 
                            implemented in Charlotte Douglas International Airport was explored and data analysis was performed on data sets obtained from members involved with 
                            the project and public databases. My teamâ€™s research paper highlighted the benefits of this new software, analyzing how further implementation can 
                            reduce delays, saving both time and money. Working with a team to develop and present a research paper shows me the importance of teamwork and 
                            cooperation. I believe that I am a team player and that my cooperative nature has allowed me to work well with others. I feel that I can be 
                            trusted with a job and that I will always try to do my best. Furthemore, I take pleasure in being around other people and interacting with them, 
                            especially those I do not know a lot about.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>In addition, my experience throughout my leadership positions in various organizations has taught me many lessons. For example, in order to advocate 
                            for early STEM education and career exploration I have volunteered extensively for Youth Coding Workshops (YCW) and led a Superposition chapter in 
                            Dublin. Through these leadership positions, I mainly focused on event planning which allowed me to become more resourceful and organized. I also 
                            learned to better manage my time since it was difficult at first to keep track of multiple different events, workshops, and tasks. However, I am 
                            glad to have gotten the opportunity to work with both organizations since I had the chance to work with many inspirational individuals and be a 
                            part of their journey in STEM. Through planning events such as a Networking with LinkedIn Workshop and leading weekly coding classes at Fallon, I 
                            gain valuable experience with leading a team, time management, and effective communication. In the future, I hope to continue my efforts with these 
                            organizations and hopefully expand our reach to a greater audience.</p>
                
                        
                        <p>All in all, thank you for taking the time to read this section of my portfolio. I encourage you to explore the rest of my website. Thank you!
