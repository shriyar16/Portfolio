                        <p>Currently, I am a freshman in high school. 
                        But, after I graduate, I would like to pursue a 
                        career in computer science engineering. To 
                        achieve this goal, I hope to gain exposure and
                        develop an interest in this field throughout my 
                        four years of high school. I plan to join clubs 
                        and organizations relating to the engineering 
                        field and maybe start a club of my own to share
                        what I have learned! Although I am fairly new to 
                        this area, I am excited to learn more and expand
                        my learning. I believe this career is well suited
                        for me because I enjoy working with
                        computers and find the process fun and 
                        exciting. Also, I would like to make a change
                        in the world and help people. A career in an 
                        industry like computer science seems to be a 
                        good way to achieve that. </p>
                        <p>Some of my major accomplishments from middle 
                        school include winning 5th place at the 
                        Bay Area Regional Science Olympiad tournament. 
                        I was on
                        the same team and participated in the same 
                        events (Forensics, Epidemiology, and Optics)
                        for two years. For the first year of the 
                        competition, my team and I did not do as well 
                        as we had hoped. So, in preparation for the 
                        following year, we worked more and studied
                        harder. As a result, we placed 6th out of 30 
                        schools across the Bay Area. I had also won 5th
                        and 6th place in two of my events. Also, to 
                        gain more experience in the Computer Science 
                        field, I began to participate in Cyberpatriot.
                        In my opinion, simply having the courage to try
                        something new and being open to new ideas was 
                        an accomplishment. I was able to attend my first 
                        competition this past November. Although there 
                        were a few things I needed to improve on, 
                        I was proud of myself for being able to attend
                        the competition and do my best. </p>
                        <p>My experiences throughout my schooling 
                        has taught me many valuable lessons. First,
                        I had learned how to be patient with myself 
                        when taking a difficult class. Although
                        academics are my strength, I got 
                        frustrated a lot when I did not understand 
                        something. This happened a lot 
                        during my Geometry class over the summer. 
                        Overtime, I learned to be patient with myself 
                        and give myself time to understand the material.
                        Furthermore, after entering high school 
                        this year, I was able to grasp how to
                        effectively manage all my classes and 
                        extracurriculars. Unlike middle school, 
                        I had a lot more on my plate and had to 
                        concentrate on balancing everything. I 
                        learned to manage my time and 
                        focus on my priorities.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I believe I am a reliable person.
                        I have been part of a couple clubs and teams
                        and I enjoy working with others. I feel that 
                        I can be trusted with work and that I can 
                        perform my best. I enjoy being around people and interacting 
                        with others, especially people I do not know a 
                        lot about. I love talking to others and helping
                        them out in any way I can.</p>
                        <p>All in all, thank you for taking your time
                        to read this section of my portfolio. I 
                        encourage you to explore the rest of my 
                        website. Thank you!</p><br>
