                        <p>Currently, I am a senior at Dublin High School. After I graduate, I would like to pursue a 
                            career in computer science engineering. To achieve this goal, I hope to gain exposure and develop a
                            passion in this field throughout my remaining years of high school. I plan to continue to take
                            engineering electives, such as Principles of Engineering and AP Computer Science Principles, that 
                            will help me build and strengthen the skills necessary to be successful in this field. I also hope 
                            to attend more guest speaker events and field trips in the future so I can learn more about the career options I have. 
                            Although I have already taken some engineering classes, I am excited to continue to expand my learning. 
                            I believe this career is well suited for me because I enjoy problem solving. Engineering also involves
                            the practical application of math and science in the real world, which greatly interests me. </p>
                        
                        <p>In an attempt to gain more experience in the world of computer science, I had joined a CyberPatriot
                            team two years ago. In my opinion, simply having the courage to try something new and being open to new
                            ideas was an accomplishment. My team and I were able to attend competitions, but we were not
                            able to qualify for the Mayorâ€™s Cup, a Bay Area cybersecurity competition. Although there were a few 
                            things my team and I needed to improve on, I was proud of us for being able to attend the competition
                            and do our best. Last year, my team and I worked harder when we attended the first two competitions of 
                            the year. To our delight, we were placed in the Platinum Tier, which is the highest level of qualifiers
                            for the next round! Being on a CyberPatriot team for three years that showed me the importance of teamwork
                            and cooperation. I believe that I am a team player and that my cooperative nature has allowed me to work 
                            well with others. I feel that I can be trusted with a job and that I will always try to do my best. 
                            Furthermore, I take pleasure in being around people and interacting with them, especially those I do not
                            know a lot about.
</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>My experience throughout my schooling has taught me many valuable lessons. First, I learned how to be patient 
                            with myself when taking a difficult class. Although academics are usually my strength, I often get frustrated 
                            when I do not understand something. This happened a lot during my sophomore year when I was trying to adjust to my new, more rigorous
                            schedule. Over time, 
                            I learned to be patient with myself and give myself time to understand the material. Furthermore, after entering
                            senior year, I was able to grasp how to effectively manage all my classes and extracurriculars. Even compared to previous years,
                            I had a lot more on my plate and had to concentrate on balancing everything. I learned to efficiently manage 
                            my time and stay focused. Additionally, my experience last year as the Treasurer of Stitch in Time, a volunteer club
                            that donates handmade crocheted goods, taught me the importance of organization and responsibility, especially when 
                            it comes to dealing with money. This position has allowed me to become more reliable and trustworthy. 
                            
                </p>
