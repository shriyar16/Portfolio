            <h4>Field Trips</h4>
                    <img class = "hangman" src="Images/workday.jpg">

            <p>During my sophomore year, I was able to take a workplace field trip to the company Workday. At Workday, I met a number of industry professionals including web developers and project managers. The team at Workday was working on a special interface for college students and staff which allowed them to access copious amounts of information from one place. I was also able to listen to a short presentation explaining the benefits of this new software. While the industry professionals presented, I was surprised to notice how different their paths were. Some had majors that weren’t even related to engineering and they all attended various colleges. Overall, this experience was memorable for me because it was the first time I got to see a workplace environment. From this experience, I realized how work in a traditional office isn’t actually as ‘boring’ or mundane as it seems.

                    <img class = "hangman" src="Images/livermore.jpg">

            <p>Furthermore, I also enjoyed our virtual field trip to tour the Livermore Aviation groups during sophomore year. I was able to hear from numerous engineers tour the facilities and talk about what their days are like. I got to see the runway where the planes take off and where the engineers and pilots care for the planes and make repairs if necessary. The panel also spoke about the impact of the pandemic on their jobs and it was interesting to see how their work day had changed as a result. Hearing from Livermore workers who worked in many different sections of the laboratory also proved to be beneficial because I was able to gain a better understanding of the vast research and ongoing projects completed at the company.

                    <img class = "hangman" src="Images/roche.jpg">

            <p>During my junior year, I attended two sessions at Roche and was able to hear from scientists who worked on the COVID-19 vaccine. The scientist talked about their development process and how they were able to create the vaccine that was very much in demand at the time. It was interesting to see the steps for product development, which was somewhat similar to what we use in our engineering classes. But, I learned that a lot of regulation, design, and evaluation goes into creating a product that is safe and effective to use. The panelists also talked about how it is important to keep in mind where you are selling your products and making sure it adheres with their given guidelines. We were able to hear from multiple different scientists and their contribution to the COVID-19 research. We also got a virtual tour of the lab so it was really exciting to see what the facility looked like.

                    <img class = "hangman" src="Images/machine.jpg">

            <p>Junior year, I was able to get a tour of the manufacturing facilities at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. Through this field trip, I gained a better understanding of the steps and processes involved in manufacturing, designing, and machining a product. The processes and safety procedures regarding multiple machine tools were also explained and the process to design, cut, and dye a keychain was shown. The machinists also spoke about their experience in the machining industry and how they had found that path. This field trip proved to be a valuable experience since it showcases a more hands-on approach to engineering as a career path I hadn’t previously considered.

            <br>
            <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
            <p>One influential guest speaker during sophomore year would have been Maynard Holliday, a robotics engineer who was the project manager for the robot, Pioneer, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. This presentation was the most memorable for me because I was intrigued by Mr. Holliday’s role in the aftermath of Chernobyl. I had learned about this nuclear disaster, but I had never met anyone who had been involved in its aftermath. Mr. Holliday’s presentation inspired me because his job seemed very interesting and different. Plus, he was able to make a difference. Additionally, this also got me more interested in mechanical engineering. I still wasn’t sure which area of engineering I had wanted to go into, but this presentation built up my interest for mechanical engineering and robotics. Moreover, Mr. Holliday spoke about the features of the robot he and his team created. The Pioneer robot was used to map the inside of Chernobyl and was able to withstand high amounts of radiation that would be dangerous for humans. The final robot was delivered in 1999 and had the ability to remain inside Chernobyl for up to two years. From Mr. Holliday’s presentation, I was surprised to learn how big of a role engineering had played in the recovery of Chernobyl. I was also interested in the mechanics and science behind the abilities of the Pioneer robot. Additionally, hearing from a college panel in the Engineering Mentorship Program during junior year was also helpful. Here, we had many mentors from various colleges discuss their experiences at school along with the careers and skills they chose to pursue after. I was able to hear from a wide variety of speakers including people from CSUs, UCs, and private universities. Some guest speakers were also more medically inclined, so it was interesting to hear about their journey after high school. These virtual webinars really gave me insight into the atmosphere and environment of different schools and helped me gain an understanding of what schools would be a good fit for me and my career path. The panelists answered some importants questions I had, such as the differences between the CSU and UC system. Overall, I was intrigued by the number of opportunities the panelists spoke about, ranging from research programs to internships. Overall, these guest speakers helped me realize that I had many options for my careers after high school. Lastly, attending Andrea Madotto’s event on Natural language Processing allowed me to see how the skills learned in class were utilized in the real world and the inner workings of NLP in addition to the future advancements in the field. During senior year, I am looking forward to attending guest speaker events featuring Nita Kaushal and Erika Bergman.

            <h4>Mentor Program</h4>
            <p>During junior year, I was able to participate in the Mentorship Program for the Engineering Academy. I was paired up with Ms. Alea DelMastro, a data analyst at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I was able to learn a lot about Ms. DelMastro's career and journey after high school. I learned about how she was applying to doctorate programs and was also researching at her college. It was interesting to gain insight about an engineering career that seemed very foreign to me. Ms. DelMastro and I had worked on goal setting for the sophomore academic year. We talked about the importance of having targeted goals and working on a detailed plan to achieve them. We also spent some time on preparation after high school. We went over my resume and I learned some valuable tips on what to include and how to format and structure my resume to make it the most appealing to employers. I gained some valuable information on how to approach interview questions and form a connection with my interviewer. These tips and discussions were really helpful for me and I will definitely be applying what I have learned in the future when I apply for another job or internship. The process of discussing future goals after highschool and getting prepared for the college admissions process by updating brag sheets, activity lists, college lists, and recommendation letter requests was also greatly helpful.

            <h4>Volunteer Experience</h4>
            <p>Lastly, I have gained significant experience working with Youth Coding Workshops (YCW), a student led non profit organization that focuses on spreading computer literacy by offering free coding workshops to allow young children to strengthen their programming knowledge. I was with this organization in its early stages, and I am very proud of how far we have come. We have over 50 students who attend our weekly workshops and along with 30 and counting who attend our branch at Fallon Middle School. By working with the other staff members at YCW, I learned the importance of working with a team and being a team player. I do not believe we would have had the success we have now if we hadn't learned to work and collaborate efficiently with one another. Furthermore, leading workshops has also taught me the importance of organization, creativity, and problem solving. I had to structure the existing curriculum so it was the easiest to understand for younger students. I also had to be creative in my method of teaching, so my students wouldn't get bored during the workshops. Lastly, I learned a lot about problem solving since I often had to work with my students to fix issues in their projects or with my own team members to address issues without our organization.
