            <h4>My Narrative</h4>
            <br>
                <p>During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number of industry professionals
                    through workplace field trips and guest speakers. These meetings were able to provide me 
                    with insight into the various jobs and areas of study that were included under the broad 
                    field of engineering. This allowed me to gain exposure to the many exciting and interesting
                    jobs. Meeting these professionals has allowed me to realize what I wanted to do in the future
                    and I was able to explore the vast amount of options I would have after graduating.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Field Trips</h4>
            <h4>Workday</h4>
            <p>During my freshman year, I was able to take a workplace field trip to the company, Workday. 
                At Workday, I met a number of industry professionals including web developers and project managers. 
                The team at Workday was working on a special interface for college students and staff which allowed 
                them to access copious amounts of information from one place. I was also able to listen to a short 
                presentation explaining the benefits of this new software. While the industry professionals presented, 
                I was surprised to notice how different their paths were. Some had majors that weren’t even related to
                engineering and they all attended various colleges. Additionally, while exploring the interior of the
                offices, I was able to see multiple flowcharts and whiteboards and I saw many people working together.
                Overall, this experience was memorable for me because it was the first time I got to see a workplace 
                environment. From this experience, I realized how work in a traditional office isn’t actually as ‘boring’ or
                mundane as it seems. During my visit, I was also able to see people collaborating and working as a team. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Livermore Aviation</h4>
            <p>Furthermore, I also enjoyed our
                virtual fieldtrip to tour the Livermore Aviation groups. Although I am inclined towards computer science, I loved exploring
                various fields of engineering to see if other areas interest me. I was able to hear from numerous engineers tour the facilities and talk about what
                their days are like. I got to see the runway where the planes take off and where the engineers and pilots care for the planes and make repairs if necessary. 
                The panel also spoke about the impact of the pandemic on their jobs and it was interesting to see how their work day had changed as a result. The speakers also 
                talked about how students can get involved with flying and the available robot garden programs and opportunities.
        </p>
            

           <br>
            <h4>Guest Speakers</h4>
            <h4>Maynard Holliday</h4>
                <p> Furthermore, one influential guest speaker would have been Maynard Holliday, a robotics engineer who was the 
                project manager for the robot, Pioneer, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. This presentation was the most memorable
                for me because I was intrigued by Mr. Holliday’s role in the aftermath of Chernobyl. I had learned about this
                nuclear disaster, but I had never met anyone who had been involved in its aftermath. Mr. Holliday’s presentation 
                inspired me because his job seemed very interesting and different. Plus, he was able to make a difference. 
                Additionally, this also got me more interested in mechanical engineering. I still wasn’t sure which area of 
                engineering I had wanted to go into, but this presentation built up my interest for mechanical engineering and 
                robotics. Moreover, Mr. Holliday spoke about the features of the robot he and his team created. The Pioneer robot
                was used to map the inside of Chernobyl and was able to withstand high amounts of radiation that would be dangerous 
                for humans. The final robot was delivered in 1999 and had the ability to remain inside Chernobyl for up to two years. 
                From Mr. Holliday’s presentation, I was surprised to learn how big of a role engineering had played in the recovery of
                Chernobyl. I was also interested in the mechanics and science behind the abilities of the Pioneer robot.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>College Panel</h4>
            <p> I was also interested in hearing from a college
            panel in the Engineering Mentorship Program. Here, we had many mentors from various colleges discuss their experiences at school along with the careers and skills
            they chose to pursue after. I was able to hear from a wide variety of speakers including people from CSUs, UCs, and private universities. Some guest speakers were
            also more medically inclined, so it was interesting to hear about their journey after high school. These virtual webinars really gave me insight into the atmosphere
            and environment of different schools and helped me gain and understanding of what schools would be a good fit for me and my career path. The panelists answered some 
            importants questions I had, such as the differences between the CSU and UC system. Overall, I was intrigued by the number of opportunities the panelists spoke about, ranging from
            research programs to interships. Overall, these guest speakers helps me realize that I had many options for my careers after high school. </p>
        <br>
            
            
      
            <h4>Mentor Program</h4>
            <p>This year, I was able to participate in the Mentorship Program for the Engineering Academy. I was paired up with Ms. Alea DelMastro, a data analyst at Lawrence Livermore
            National Laboratory. I was able to learn a lot about Ms. DelMastro's career and journey after high school. I learned about how she was applying to doctorate programs and was
            also researching at her college. It was intersting to gain insight about an engineering career that seemed very foreign to me. Ms. DelMastro and I had worked on goal setting for
            this academic year. We talked about the importance of having targeted goals and working on a detailed plan to achieve them. We also spent some time on preparation after high school.
            We went over my resume and I learned some valuable tips on what to include and how to format and structure my resume to make it the most appealling to employers. I gained some valuable 
            information on how to approach interview questions and form a connection with my interviewer. These tips and discussions were really helpful for me and I will definitely be applying what I have
            learned in the future when I apply for another job or internship. Currently, we are in the process of discussing future goals after highschool and getting prepared for the college
            admissions process by updating brag sheets, activity lists, college lists, and recommendation letter requests. </p>
        <br>
            
            
              <br>
            <p>Lastly, I have gained significant experience working with Youth Coding Workshops (YCW), a student led non profit organization that focuses on spreading computer literacy by offering
            free coding workshops to allow young children to strengthen their programming knowledge. I was with this organization in its early stages, and I am very proud of how far we have come. We have over
            50 students who attend our weekly workshops and along with 30 and counting who attend our branch at Fallon Middle School. By working with the other staff members at YCW, I learned the importance of
            working with a team and being a team player. I do not believe we would have had the success we have now if we hadn't learned to work and collaborate efficiently with one another. Furthermore, leading
            workshops has also taught me the importance of organization, creativity, and problem solving. I had to structure the existing curriculm so it was the easiest to understand for younger students. I also had
            to be creative in my method of teaching, so my students wouldn't get bored during the workshops. Lastly, I learned a lot about problem solving since I often had to work with my students to fix issues in
            their projects or with my own team members to address issues without our organization.</p>
