            <h4>My Narrative</h4>
            <br>
                <p>During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number of industry professionals
                    through workplace field trips and guest speakers. These meetings were able to provide me 
                    with insight into the various jobs and areas of study that were included under the broad 
                    field of engineering. This allowed me to gain exposure to the many exciting and interesting
                    jobs. Meeting these professionals has allowed me to realize what I wanted to do in the future
                    and I was able to realize the vast amount of options I would have after graduating.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my freshman year, I was able to take a workplace field trip to the company, Workday. 
                At Workday, I met a number of industry professionals including web developers and project managers. 
                The team at Workday was working on a special interface for college students and staff which allowed 
                them to access copious amounts of information from one place. I was also able to listen to a short 
                presentation explaining the benefits of this new software. While the industry professionals presented, 
                I was surprised to notice how different their paths were. Some had majors that weren’t even related to
                engineering and they all attended various colleges. Additionally, while exploring the interior of the
                offices, I was able to see multiple flowcharts and whiteboards and I saw many people working together.
                Overall, this experience was memorable for me because it was the first time I got to see a workplace 
                environment. From this experience, I realized how work in a traditional office isn’t actually as ‘boring’ or
                mundane as it seems. During my visit, I was also able to see people collaborating and working as a team.</p>
           <br>
            <p>Furthermore, one influential guest speaker would have been Maynard Holliday, a robotics engineer who was the 
                project manager for the robot, Pioneer, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. This presentation was the most memorable
                for me because I was intrigued by Mr. Holliday’s role in the aftermath of Chernobyl. I had learned about this
                nuclear disaster, but I had never met anyone who had been involved in its aftermath. Mr. Holliday’s presentation 
                inspired me because his job seemed very interesting and different. Plus, he was able to make a difference. 
                Additionally, this also got me more interested in mechanical engineering. I still wasn’t sure which area of 
                engineering I had wanted to go into, but this presentation built up my interest for mechanical engineering and 
                robotics. Moreover, Mr. Holliday spoke about the features of the robot he and his team created. The Pioneer robot
                was used to map the inside of Chernobyl and was able to withstand high amounts of radiation that would be dangerous 
                for humans. The final robot was delivered in 1999 and had the ability to remain inside Chernobyl for up to two years. 
                From Mr. Holliday’s presentation, I was surprised to learn how big of a role engineering had played in the recovery of
                Chernobyl. I was also interested in the mechanics and science behind the abilities of the Pioneer robot. </p>
